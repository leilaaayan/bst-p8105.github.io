# Examples of flatly
We're gonna look at nyc airbnb data.
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library("p8105.datasets")
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
data("nyc_airbnb")

nyc_airbnb = 
  nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(rating = review_scores_location / 2) %>%
  select(neighbourhood_group, neighbourhood, rating, price, lat, long, room_type) %>%
  filter(
    neighbourhood_group =="Manhattan",
    price %in% 100: 500, # price in the range of100 and 500
    room_type == "Entire home/apt"
  ) %>%
  drop_na(rating)

```



# Plotly plots
## Scatterplot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(text_label = str_c("Price: $", price, "\nRating:", rating)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    x = ~lat, y= ~long, color= ~price, text = ~rating, alpha = .5, type ="scatter", mode = "markers") # specify asecetic mapping


```

## boxplot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, price)) %>%
  plot_ly(
    y = ~price, x = ~neighbourhood, color= ~neighbourhood,
    type = "box", colors = "viridis")
```
## bar plot
```{r}
nyc_airbnb %>%
  count(neighbourhood) %>%
  mutate(neighbourhood = fct_reorder(neighbourhood, n)) %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~neighbourhood, y= ~ n, color = ~neighbourhood, type = "bar", colors = "viridis")
```


# ggplotly

```{r}
ggp_scatter = 
nyc_airbnb %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color=price)) +
  geom_point()

ggplotly(ggp_scatter)
```
